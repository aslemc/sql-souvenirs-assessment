# sql-souvenirs-assessment

The first assessment for Dev10 required us to normalize a dataset & load it into a SQL database in Azure Data Studio. At that point, I had only one week of experience
with SQL and database management. I submitted the following deliverables:

* souvenirs-denormalized.csv
  * This is the denormalized dataset we were provided with
* ERD.drawio
  * This is the entity relationship diagram for my database
* souvenirs-schema
  * My DDL file, showing the SQL schema that I ran to create the database
* souvenirs-data
  * My DML file, showing the SQL that I ran to load the denormalized data into the normalized schema
  * It also includes a few updates & deletions required by the rubric
* souvenirs-queries
  * This file includes the queries I was required to run as part of the assessment
